# Petros

This sketch is an homage to a piece of work painted by my grandfather, Peter Waldron. He was an artist all his life, and found joy and success in his passion. He owned a house on the island of Crete, and I spent many holidays there as a child, and loved it. What I especially loved about these trips was watching him paint, which he would do in the amazing central living space of this classical Cretan home, a wonderful building made of stone and painted white to keep out the heat.

One of his series involved wonderful minimal paintings of houses in Crete. He gifted one of these to me when I turned 16, as I had expressed how much I liked them. As I can't paint myself, but I can type some words on a keyboard, I wanted to pay my respects in a way I know how.
