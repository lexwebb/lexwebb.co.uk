# Hi, I'm Lex

I'm a software developer with a passion for front-end website development. I've spent much of my working time on enterprise data visualization software and content delivery platforms. In my spare time, I like to experiment with new web technology as well as dabble in video game development.

## What am I doing right now?
At the moment I am working on a game development project that i've been thinking about for a long time. It's a bit of a diversion from my professional skill-set, but i'm digging up some old C# experience and cracking on with it,

## How did I get here?

My interest in computers started when I was around the age of 11, scrounging time on my mother's Apple Macs to play flash games and try to learn their secrets. My first introduction into coding was attempting to make terrible flash games around the age of 12. Safe to say I was pretty bad at this at the time and didn't get very far with my short 12-year-old attention span. Fast forward to the end of secondary school and I had to choose my subjects to study at college; I chose Maths, Physics, Graphics, and finally Computing, I was going to give it a proper shot.

Having spent my time growing up around computers and video games, I decided to take Computing. At the time I thought it would just be a bit of fun, but once starting it I noticed I had a developed an aptitude for it. And what's more, I WANTED to learn about it, so I took it and ran with it. When it came to time to choose what to study a university, the choice was obvious, Computer Science. Here is where my learning took off and advanced me towards my career.
