# Hi, I'm Lex

I'm a software developer with a passion for front-end website development. I've spent a lot of my working time on enterprise data visualization software and content delivery platforms. In my spare time, I like to experiment with new web technology as well as dabble in video game development.

## How did I get here?

Well, long story, but skipping the obvious parts my interest in computers started from a young age, scrounging time on my mother's Apple Macs to play flash games and try to learn their secrets. My first foray into coding was attempting to make terrible flash games around the age of 12. Safe to say I was pretty bad at this at the time and didn't get very far with my short 12-year-old attention span. Fast forward to the end of secondary school and I had to choose my subjects to study at college; I chose Maths, Physics, and Graphics, however, I needed a fourth.

Having spent my time growing up around computers and video games, I decided to take Computing. At the time I thought it would just be a bit of fun, but once starting it I noticed I had a natural aptitude for it. And what's more, I WANTED to learn about it, so I took it and ran. Fast forward once again to going to university and the choice was obvious, and I chose to study Computer Science. Here is where my learning took off and advanced me towards my career.
